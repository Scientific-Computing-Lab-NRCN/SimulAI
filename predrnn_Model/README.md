# PredRNN (NIPS 2017)
A PyTorch implementation of PredRNN [[paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6689-predrnn-recurrent-neural-networks-for-predictive-learning-using-spatiotemporal-lstms)], a recurrent network with *twisted and zigzag space-time memory cells* for video data. Given a sequence of previous frames, our model generates future frames for multiple timestamps.

Video prediction networks have been used for precipitation nowcasting, early activity recognition, physical scene understanding, model-based visual planning, and unsupervised representation learning of video data.

## Get Started
1. Install Python 3.7, PyTorch 1.3, and OpenCV 3.4.  

2. Download data. This repo contains code for two datasets: the [Moving Mnist dataset](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AuK5cwCfU3__fGzXjcOlzTQw158) and the [KTH action dataset](http://www.nada.kth.se/cvap/actions/).  

3. Train the model. You can use the following bash script to train the model. The learned model will be saved in the `--save_dir` folder. 
The generated future frames will be saved in the `--gen_frm_dir` folder.  
```
cd script/
sh predrnn_mnist_train.sh
```
